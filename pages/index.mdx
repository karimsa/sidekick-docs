# Introduction

Sidekick is your personal toolkit for having an incredible development experience.

## Getting Started

Sidekick can be installed into your project using any JS package manager. The only peer dependency it has is `zod`.

<Tabs items={['yarn', 'npm']}>
  <Tab>
```bash
yarn add -D --exact @karimsa/sidekick@latest zod@latest
```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
```bash
npm install -D --save-exact @karimsa/sidekick@latest zod@latest
```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Next, you must configure sidekick using a `sidekick.config.ts` file. For more information, see the [configuration](/docs/configuration) page.

Finally, you can start sidekick by running:

```
$ yarn sidekick start
Sidekick started on http://[::1]:9010
```

You should then be able to access sidekick through any web browser by visiting `http://[::1]:9010` (or `http://localhost:9010` on most machines).

**Tip: you can modify your `/etc/hosts` file to add `sidekick.local ::1` so you can quickly access sidekick by entering `sidekick.local` and allowing your browser to auto-complete the full URL.**

## Release channels

There are multiple release channels available for sidekick. The default channel, stable, is installed and
managed through JS package managers (see instructions above). All other channels are installed and managed
by sidekick itself.

 * `stable`: The default channel. This is the recommended channel for most users. It includes features that
 have been tested and considered to be safe to use in production. The source for this channel is tagged commits
 on the `main` branch.
 * `beta`: The beta channel includes features that are generally considered stable, and will soon be promoted to
 the stable channel. The source for this channel is the `main` branch.
 * `nightly`: The nightly channel includes features that have completed development, but are currently being tested
 in production. The source for this channel is the `develop` branch.

**To install a new sidekick channel, run:**

<Tabs items={['beta', 'nightly']}>
  <Tab>
```bash
sidekick-upgrade install --channel beta --activate
```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
```bash
sidekick-upgrade install --channel nightly --activate
```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

**To remove a sidekick channel, run:**

<Tabs items={['beta', 'nightly']}>
  <Tab>
```bash
sidekick-upgrade remove --channel beta
```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
```bash
sidekick-upgrade remove --channel nightly
```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

**To check what version of sidekick your project is set to use:**

```bash
$ yarn sidekick version
{
  version: '0.10.3',
  mode: 'production',
  releaseChannel: 'stable',
  node: 'v18.12.1'
}
```

There is no fixed release schedule, and there is no guarantee that features from `nightly` will be promoted to `beta` in chronological order.
