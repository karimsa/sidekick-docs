# Introduction

Sidekick is your personal toolkit for having an incredible development experience.

## Getting Started

Sidekick can be installed into your project using any JS package manager:

<Tabs items={['yarn', 'npm']}>
  <Tab>
```bash
yarn add -D --exact @karimsa/sidekick@latest
```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
```bash
npm install -D --save-exact @karimsa/sidekick@latest
```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Release channels

There are multiple release channels available for sidekick. The default channel, stable, is installed and
managed through JS package managers (see instructions above). All other channels are installed and managed
by sidekick itself.

 * `stable`: The default channel. This is the recommended channel for most users. It includes features that
 have been tested and considered to be safe to use in production. The source for this channel is tagged commits
 on the `main` branch.
 * `beta`: The beta channel includes features that are generally considered stable, and will soon be promoted to
 the stable channel. The source for this channel is the `main` branch.
 * `nightly`: The nightly channel includes features that have completed development, but are currently being tested
 in production. The source for this channel is the `develop` branch.

**To install a new sidekick channel, run:**

<Tabs items={['beta', 'nightly']}>
  <Tab>
```bash
sidekick-upgrade install --channel beta --activate
```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
```bash
sidekick-upgrade install --channel nightly --activate
```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

**To remove a sidekick channel, run:**

<Tabs items={['beta', 'nightly']}>
  <Tab>
```bash
sidekick-upgrade remove --channel beta
```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
```bash
sidekick-upgrade remove --channel nightly
```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

There is no fixed release schedule, and there is no guarantee that features from `nightly` will be promoted to
`beta` in chronological order.
